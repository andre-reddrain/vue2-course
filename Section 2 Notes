# Lesson 11 - How the VueJS Template Syntax and Instance Work Together

- We can run Vue Methods inside HTML DOMs. However, we have to return something to the DOM that the DOM can load. In other words, <p> can contain any text. If we return a string to the <p>, it can load it.

###### Example #####
methods: {
    sayHello: function() {
        return 'Hello!';
    }
}

<p>{{ sayHello() }}</p>

Result: Hello!

# Lesson 12 - Accessing Data in the Vue Instance

- We can return any data's property from the methods. However, we need to add "this." before the name of the property, since the methods don't have direct access to data. 

##### Example #####
sayHello: function() {
    return title;
}

Result: ✘ (title is not defined)
---//---//---
sayHello: function() {
    return this.title;
}

Result: ✔
