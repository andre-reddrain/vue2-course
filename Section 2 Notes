# Lesson 11 - How the VueJS Template Syntax and Instance Work Together

- We can run Vue Methods inside HTML DOMs. However, we have to return something to the DOM that the DOM can load. In other words, <p> can contain any text. If we return a string to the <p>, it can load it.

###### Example #####
methods: {
    sayHello: function() {
        return 'Hello!';
    }
}

<p>{{ sayHello() }}</p>

Result: Hello!
######

# Lesson 12 - Accessing Data in the Vue Instance

- We can return any data's property from the methods. However, we need to add "this." before the name of the property, since the methods don't have direct access to data. 

##### Example #####
sayHello: function() {
    return title;
}

Result: ✘ (title is not defined)
---//---//---
sayHello: function() {
    return this.title;
}

Result: ✔

# Lesson 13 - Binding to Attributes

- We can only use {{ }} on places where there normally is text. WE CANNOT use {{ }} on HTML elements.
- v-bind binds the Vue data property or method onto the HTML element.

##### Example (Link = google.com) #####
<p>{{ sayHello() }} - <a href="{{ link }}">Google</a></p>

Link: "%7B%7B%20link%20%7D%7D" -> "{{ link }}" is encoded as the link itself

<p>{{ sayHello() }} - <a v-bind:href="link">Google</a></p>

Link: "google.com" -> We bing the link property to the <a> element.

# Lesson 15 - Disable Re-Rendering with v-once

- v-once will make the HTML render once and will not be updated if it changes later in the code.

#####

# Lesson 16 - How to Output Raw HTML

- The default behavior of Vue.js is rendering in text form. This behavior ensures that there will be no CRSR problems.
- v-html will render the data as a HTML element.

#####

# Lesson 19 - Listening to Events

- v-on will listen to any declared event (mouseOn, click, mouseHover...).

##### Example #####

v-on:click="increase"

v-on:click -> Event that is going to be listening (click).
increase -> Method declared on Vue instance.

#####

# Lesson 20 - Getting Event Data from the Event Object

- "event" is created automatically and can be used as a parameter to our methods.
