# Lesson 37 - Conditional Rendering with v-if

- v-if attaches or detaches elements to the DOM. It does not hide them.

- v-else will automatically refer to the lattest v-if.

- If v-if detaches an element, all nested elements will also be detached.

# Lesson 38 - v-else-if in Vue.js 2.1

- From Version 2.1 and so on, there is actually a v-else-if.

- Documentation on v-else-if: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/conditional.html#v-else-if

#####

# Lesson 39 - Using an Alternative v-if Syntax

- We can create a <template>, which can nest any elements. <template> is not read by the HTML as an element, therefore it's not displayed on the Inspect Page.

- Using <template> can be used to show or hide many elements, without using any default HTML elements. We can replace it with <div>, but it might have some side effects.

- By hiding the <template>, any nested elements, as previously stated, will be detatched.

#####

# Lesson 40 - Don't Detach it with v-show

- v-show works the same way as v-if, only difference is that it does not detach the element from the DOM.

#####

# Lesson 41 - Rendering Lists with v-for

- v-for is used to output a list. Syntax: v-for="person in persons".
