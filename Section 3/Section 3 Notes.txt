# Lesson 37 - Conditional Rendering with v-if

- v-if attaches or detaches elements to the DOM. It does not hide them.

- v-else will automatically refer to the lattest v-if.

- There is no v-elseif. For that, just create a new v-if statement.

- If v-if detaches an element, all nested elements will also be detached.
